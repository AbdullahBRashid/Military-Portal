## Thoughts
Its just a showcase of a few skills I learnt over the past few years. The project is not perfect and there are many things that can be improved. I had no better idea and had this project to build in a competition which I couldn't do so I thought why not make it to learn it. I hope you like it. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
Thanks for reading.
